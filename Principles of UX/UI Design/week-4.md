Designing your UI
-----------------




* Enhancing your design *

1) - Stylize High-fidelity design
A high fidelity wireframe is a realistic prototype that closely resembles the final design of a project. It can include typography, colors, images, icons, and buttons. These types of wireframes take longer than the low and medium fidelity kind which means more resources are usually allocated to complete them.

2) - Mood boards in design
Mood boards are graphic panels that combine different sensory sources to create a dynamic environment that acts as a guide for creative decisions. Photos, colors, illustrations, animations, fonts and textures can be used to develop a mood board that explains the emotions you want to arouse in users while also merging the creative vision of the design.   




* Design Systems *

3) - Design Systems
The design systems have fantastic resources to generate flexible, consistent and reusable designs for the user. It is everything that goes into creating your product, including typography, colors, icons, layouts, grids, coding standards and naming conventions. It can also be a guide on the tone of voice for your content. A style guide and documentation for developers. A design system combines all of these in a way that enables your team to develop, learn and work together. 

4) - UI kit
A UI kit is similar to a design system, but as its name suggests, it is limited to the elements and features that populate a user interface or UI. A UI kit still shows a systematic approach to design, for example, a typographic scale or a color system. It can list a set of buttons, menu items or components but it is not as thorough as a design system. 




* Prototyping, Sharing and testing your designs *

5) - Prototyping
A prototype is an almost working model or mock-up of the product, which you use to test it with prospective users and stakeholders. Using interactive prototypes, you can show how the design will act in a way that is helpful in assisting others to understand what your design would look like and behave once the final product is built. 

6) - Micro-interactions and micro-animations
Animation refers to the movement or change in an element on a page, while microinteractions refer to small, interactive details that provide feedback to the user.
Micro-animations - It preferably functional animations that support the user by giving visual feedback and displaying changes more clearly. 
Micro-interactions - This are small momentary animations or responses that occur when a user interacts with a specific element.
