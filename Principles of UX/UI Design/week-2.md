Evaluating interactive design
-----------------------------




* Evaluation methodologies *

1) - Evaluating design
providing users with visually engaging and usable product designs are not entirely all that different. Another thing to consider is the beauty of functionality. use these recommendations as aids to spot bad habits before they happen and think about more usable alternatives that satisfy these.

2) - Designing for accessibility
that you can use when you're building a product and when you're launching it to make sure that it's accessible for everyone. We want our products to be able to work with a screen reader so that nonsighted people can use. The screen reader is able to properly identify all parts of the page. Then there are other sitewide things that we have, like variable font sizes that are just given for free when you building a new feature. 




* Best practice principles *

3) - Form design
The simple fact is that analyzing interactive forms in the context of usability and user goals helps you to create logical and user-centered solutions that all users are familiar with. Form design is about creating a web form where your site visitors can enter and submit information while keeping the layout, format, user experience (UX), appearance and other factors in mind. A well-designed form improves the user experience and increases conversions, which means that you turn users into customers.

4) - Components in UI design
A component is any part of your design that can be logically grouped which is thought of as stand alone and can be reused. First you start small and build one component at a time. Then you combine components to create a more complex component and finally you build interfaces using these individual and combined components.

5) - A design system
It is a set of reusable pre made design components and patterns that can be used to design products at scale similar to a brand style guide. They contain rules and best practice behaviors for design components.  

6) - Navigation 
There are two broad methods you can consider to make your users feel comfortable. The first one is content strategy, and the second one is information architecture.  
Content strategy - involves presenting the content on your website in a meaningful way that will promote your products. And it helps to 
                   align your client's business and UX goals. It also assists in aligning your content around your personas and scenarios. 
Information architecture - can be used to find out what you need to know to design good navigation. The information for larger websites may 
                           need to be structured and indexed in a certain way to support good navigation.
