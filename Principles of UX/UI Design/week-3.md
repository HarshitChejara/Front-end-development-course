Applied Design Fundamentals
---------------------------




* Figma Fundamentals *
 
1) - Frames, layers and basic shapes
Frames - In other design tools, this may be referred to as an Artboard. Think of it as a container where your design lives. 
layers - A layer is an object within a frame. As you add an object to a frame, a new layer will be created.
group - In a group, multiple objects can be combined, and once combined, a single top layer is created which contains all the objects. 

2) - Responsive design
It is an approach to web page creation that makes use of flexible layouts which removes the need to design layouts to suit every device.

3) - Grids and constraints
A web page or app is built of squares and rectangles, which are contained within a grid system or a structure of invisible lines and columns. They organize the content on the page, and create alignment and order. They form the basic structure of the user interface.

4) - Manipulating elements
It is a combination of align, scale and combine elements.




* Iterative design *

5) - Wireframing
The purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for each screen and the design before things like branding, colors and images are considered. It provides a way of communicating ideas quickly, which can be refined later. You focus on the user experience, on what they need to accomplish a task.

6) - rapid prototyping
Rapid prototyping is the process of creating a fast, preliminary version that closely resembles the final product. To understand rapid prototyping, it is helpful to consider where the term originated. The phrase "rapid prototyping" comes from the manufacturing industry. Rapid prototyping is used in manufacturing to create a 3D model of a product or a single component of a product.

7) - Usability testing
Usability testing is the process of getting actual people to use a website app or other products you've designed while tracking their actions and reactions. Usability testing is crucial to ensure you create an effective, efficient and delightful experience for your users.
There are many types of usability testing:- facilitator, participant and tasks.

facilitator - It gives the participants tasks. They monitor the participants behavior and listen to feedback as they complete these tasks. 
              It may also ask follow-up questions to get further information from the participant. 

participant - The participant is a user of the product you have designed or a similar product. Practical actions that the participant might 
              carry out in every day life are used as the tasks in a usability test.

tasks - the tasks wording can lead participants to misinterpret what they are required to complete or affect how they carry out the task. 

qualitative usability testing  - aims to gather insights, results and narratives about how users interact with the product. 

quantitative usability testing - is to gather metrics that capture the user experience. Tasks, success and time on task are two metrics 
                                 frequently collected in quantitative usability testing.
