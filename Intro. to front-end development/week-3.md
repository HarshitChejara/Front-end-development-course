* Intro to UI Frameworks and Libraries *

1) - Introduction to responsive design
Responsive design means that a web page can automatically stretch or shrink depending on the screen is displayed on. Responsive design is a set of three practices that allows a website to automatically change its visuals. It is the combination of three techniques, flexible grids, fluid images and media queries. When these elements are used together, you build a website that will automatically adjust its layout based on the device

2) - Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a collection of pre-written code chunks in CSS and JavaScript that allows you to create websites more quickly than if you had to create every bit of code from scratch. Building websites from scratch every time will be quite time-consuming. 

3) - Bootstrap styles
It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.

4) - Bootstrap grid
Bootstrap provides responsive grid and responsive breakpoints as part of its library. The bootstrap grid system helps us to create web page layouts through a series of rows and columns and container.

5) - Bootstrap Components
Bootstrap includes a pre made set of UI elements and styles to help you build your website. They range from alert messages to navigation menus. These are called bootstrap components.




* Introduction to React *

6) - Static and Dynamic content
Static content is files that the server transfers just as they are stored on the web server, such as videos or images. 
Dynamic content is generated when the HTTP request is made. The web server communicates with another kind of server, called an application server or a back-end. The application server generates the dynamic content that the web server sends back to the user's browser. 

7) - Single page applications
It it means is that there is only one HTML page that gets sent from the server to the browser, but that page will update its content as your users interact with your website. It allows the user to interact with the website without the application needing to download entire new web pages. Instead, it rewrites the current web page as the user interacts with it. The result is a browsing experience that feels faster and more responsive to user input. 

8) - React
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It focused on working with components, which are reusable UI components which present data that changes over time and makes it simple to build functional user interfaces on web and mobile. React uses this virtual DOM to update the browser DOM, only when it needs to.

9) - The Virtual DOM
It works like components are updated, React checks to see if the componentâ€™s HTML code in the virtual DOM matches the browser DOM. If a change is required, the browser DOM is updated. If nothing has changed, then no update is performed.

10) - Component hierarchy
Every React application contains at least one component, the root component or app component. Components are added to the app component to build out a tree structure of components that make up the application.
