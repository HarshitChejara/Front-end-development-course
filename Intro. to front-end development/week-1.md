A web server has many functions which includes website storage and administration, data storage, security and managing email. Another primary function is to handle something known as a web request. When you open a browser on your device and type the name of the website, it's the job of the web server to send you back to that website's content. This process is known as the request response cycle. Web servers are also designed to respond to thousands of requests from clients per second.
