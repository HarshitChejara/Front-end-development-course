* Get Started with HTML *

1) - HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Hypertext is text which contains links to other text. Markup refers to tags and elements used within a document. HTML elements with their opening and closing tags, and angle brackets build up an HTML document. These elements form the structure of a web page and describe to the web browser what to display.

2) - DOM
it is simply a tree, structure or model of the objects in your HTML file. all the elements in the HTML file are represented as objects in the document object model. with JavaScript to access and modify the DOM to make your webpages dynamic. 

3) - Web accessibility
It means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. It allow people with disabilities to understand navigate and interact with websites. it includes all disabilities that affect interaction with websites such as audio and visual disabilities, cognitive and neurological disabilities and physical and speech disabilities. 




* CSS Basics *

4) -  Selecting and styling 
CSS tells the web browser how to display html elements on screen. When using CSS, there are five elements you need to understand. A declaration block starts with a left curly bracket and ends with the matching right curly bracket. In between these curly brackets are the style declarations. 

5) - Box model interoduction
the web browser needs to know how to display the elements on the screen. To do this, it allocates a rectangle or box to each element. CSS rules are applied to the boxes of the elements. This is known as the box model.Every box consists of four parts. The content, the padding, the border, and finally, the margin.

6) - Document flow - block VS inline
block - A block level element will occupy the full horizontal width of its parent element and the vertical height of its content. Each
        block level element will have a new line before and after.
inline - In line elements only occupy the width and height of their content. They don't appear on a new line, hence the name in line.
        Therefore, multiple in line elements can form a row of elements.
