* Other JavaScript environments *

1) - node & NPM
Node.js is a separate standalone environment. This means that Node.js can run in multiple settings. For example, on the command line, in a desktop application, or on the back end of a web app. Node.js comes with a package manager called npm, which stands for Node Package Manager. The package manager allows you to use a large number of libraries and frameworks as Node.js modules.

2) - Testing
Testing code in this way ensures three things. Conciseness as it's straightforward and to the point, since there are only two function calls to explain what is the expected result. Clarity, because you know exactly what arguments you're providing, and repeatability, as you can run it again and again with the same arguments each time. 

3) - Types of testing
There are three types of testing:- e2e, integration and unit testing.
e2e - In testing tries to imitate how a user might interact with your app. This means that in Italy testing you need to open your web 
      application in a browser and then test it by interacting with the page the same way a user might interact with it. E two E tests are the slowest and take the most time to set up and run. 
Integration - It is testing how parts of your system interact with other parts of your system. In other words, it's testing how separate 
              parts of your apps work together.     
Unit - It is the process of testing the smallest units of your source code in isolation. A good example of this is functions. A unit is the 
       smallest piece of code that you can test separately from the rest of the app.      

4) - Introduction to Jest
It is a JavaScript testing framework. It's often used for testing code like React. It's also easy to test asynchronous code in Jest. There are no difficult setups and tests are relatively easy to code even for newcomers to the framework. It allows you to perform snapshot testing.    

5) - TDD (Test-Driven Development)
It is a streamlined process of writing code that will satisfy some requirements. It is a benchmark for knowing that your program is working as expected. It gives you the confidence that your program is working correctly. Therefore, irrespective of any future development on your codebase, TDD provides an effective way to test if your program is still working appropriately.
