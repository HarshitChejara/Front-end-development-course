The Building Blocks of a Program
--------------------------------




* Arrays, Objects and Functions *

1) - Functions
It works running the same set of stored instructions repeatedly without requiring you to adjust the settings every time. you can passed  values to the function are called arguments. and use it where ever you want in your code. 

2) - Arrays
JavaScript has a piece of functionality that allows you to store and rearrange sequenced collections of items. This is called an array. JavaScript understand that we will group a sequence of variables in a collection, we use arrays.

3) - Objects
In programming, if you have groups of data that you would like to relate, you can assign them to something known as an object. Using objects, we can resolve long variable by shortening our variable names and getting JavaScript to understand that all those variables are related. Objects can be described as collections of related properties where each property is represented as a key value pair.

4) - Math object 
The random method - The math object is really useful when using some of its built in methods, For example, this method allows you to generate a decimal number between 0 and 0.99.  

The Ceil method - This is used to round up any decimal number to the nearest integer. 

5) - Typeof
It is use to identify the data type of elements in JavaScript. The type of operator accepts and evaluates a parameter and returns the name of the data type represented as a string. To use it, you can type typeof followed by the parameter enclosed within parentheses.




* Error Handling *

6) - Bugs and Errors
When a bug happens, our program keeps running, but it behaves in a way we didn't intend. When an error happens, our program stops running as the result of an error.

7) - Try catch blocks
If a piece of code throws an error, it can get wrapped inside a try block. Then you can catch the error with the catch block, and use it to do something. Using the throw keyword, you can force an error to be thrown from the try block to the catch block. you can use the throw keyword outside the try block.

8) - Undefined, null and empty values
Null - It represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is also a return value of some built-in JavaScript methods.
Undefined - It can only hold one value, undefined. the undefined value appears is when a variable is declared without an assignment.
Empty value - This is a string without any characters inside of it.
