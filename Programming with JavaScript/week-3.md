* Introduction to Functional Programming *

1) -  Functional Programming
functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions to create programs that are more predictable and easier to reason about.

2) - Function calling and Recursion
A function call is an expression containing the function name followed by the function call operator, () . 
Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function. 

3) - Scope
Scope is all about code accessibility. It determines which parts of the code are accessible and which parts are inaccessible. You may recall that all the code outside of functions is referred to as global scope, and all the code inside of a function is known as local scope.

4) - Scoping with var, let and const
let and const - variables with let or const, they become immediately scoped to the code block they were created in. With a let or a const variable, you cannot use it in your code before you declare it. 
var - you can use it in your code even before it is declared. Also, you can redeclare the same variable when you use VAR. 




* Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming *

5) - OOP
OOP revolves around the idea of organizing our programs using objects to group related data and functionality. This is in contrast to the functional programming approach, where the data used in the app needs to be kept separate from functions that operate on that data. With the OOP approach, you create an object and store all data related to that object including variables, functions and output statements. ou may recall that functions inside objects are known as methods. An advantage to using the OoP approach is that you can build as many objects as you need.
