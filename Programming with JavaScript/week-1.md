1) - Introduction to Programming with JavaScript
introduces you to programming in JavaScript, which includes learning about variables, datatypes, operators, strings, booleans, and numbers. After this, you'll progress to learning about conditional statements and loops. for taht you need to set up software called VS or Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a code editor that developers use to write their JavaScript code.

2) - Introduction to Programming
Programming is simply the process of writing the steps a computer needs to take to complete a certain task. To program these instructions, we use programming languages. A programming language is sort of like a bridge that we use to facilitate communication between computers and people. 

3) - JavaScript
JavaScript is a language that builds interactivity into web pages. JavaScript has been the main way to interact with web pages on the client side, the front and side of websites and web applications. Using JavaScript updates are displayed in real time on our devices. Its allows us to directly interact with our web pages dynamically on the client. 

4) - Variables
Variables are containers for storing information. It allow us to make the exact same code produce different results, for making our programs versatile. 

5) - Data Types
There are seven primitive data types in JavaScript. These are string, number, Boolean, null, undefined, BigInt and symbol. 
strings and numbers - text values are known as the string data type while numerical values are referred to as the number data type.
boolean - the Boolean data type has only two values, true and false. This means that it is useful for making decisions. 
null - which only has the value null and represents the absence of value.
undefined - which can only hold the value undefined and usually refers to a variable that has not yet been assigned a value. 
BigInt - which is like an extra large box that can accommodate a much greater range of numbers than the number data type.
symbol - which can be used as a unique identifier.

6) - Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. An operator is used to manipulate individual data items and return a result.
