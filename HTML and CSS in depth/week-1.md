* Introduction to HTML and CSS *

1) - HTML and CSS
HTML is a markup language used to create webpages. In fact, it's the most basic and fundamental language for creating webpages. Together with CSS, it has helped the web browser expand beyond just desktop computers. CSS is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the look and layout of a document written in HTML. The usage of HTML and CSS has grown beyond the traditional web browser and webpages.




* Semantic and Meta Tags *

2) - Semantic tags
Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. For example, tags like <header>, <article>, and <footer> are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain. On the other hand, tags like <div> and <span> are typical examples of non-semantic HTML.

3) - Metadata
It's data about other data. The meta element has two attributes, name and content. The name attribute specifies the name of the metadata and the content attribute specifies the value of the metadata. there are some types:- author description, keywords, robots and view ports metadata etc.
author - The author metadata specifies the author of the web page. 
description - The description metadata describes the content of the web page. 
keywords - The keywords metadata was previously used to provide search keywords for search engines.
robots - It tells search engines if and how they should analyze your web page.
view port - The view port metadata is important when designing responsive web pages. 




* User Input and Forms *

4) - Forms and validation
Form validation is a process that ensures that the data entered by the user in a form is valid and conforms to rules defined by the developer. There are two methods of form validation, client-side validation and server-side validation. 
client-side validation - It checks for errors as soon as they are typed into the form. the process starts by checking if a form has been 
                         filled out correctly. If there are no errors, the form will be submitted to the server for processing. However, if there are errors, an error message will alert the user of the invalid data and how to change it for successful submission. 
server-side validation - It checks for errors after the data has been submitted to the web server. It prevents malicious users from 
                         tampering with your website's code and submitting invalid data to your server. When the form data is received by the web server, the backend will validate the data before processing it.




* Media Elements *

5) - iFrames
An iframe is HTML element that allows you to place or embed content from another website into a webpage. it runs the embedded webpage, similar to how a webpage runs in another tab of your web browser. It used to display adverts, but it can also be used to embed content from another website, such as a social media post.  

6) - The canvas element
It can be used to draw graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript). This can, for instance, be used to draw graphs, combine photos, or create simple animations.
