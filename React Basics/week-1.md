* Introduction to React Basics *

1) - React
There's a part of the reason why React is so popular, is because it streamlines the process of building and composing components. React does this efficiently and without a significant impact on your browser's resources. A working with state in React apps. State is simply all the values of all the variables your app is working with at any given point in time.




* React components and Where They Live *

2) - Why React?
It is a very declarative, fast, and flexible JavaScript library. It allows you to create complex user interfaces using “components,” or small, self-contained pieces of code. its potential to reuse components. It saves time for developers as they don't have to write various codes for the same features. Furthermore, if any changes are made in any particular part, it will not affect other parts of the application.

3) - React.js overview
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen.

4) - functional components
which acts like a JavaScript function. Tt accepts the data in the form of props and returns the react element. We can create a functional component in React by writing a JavaScript function. These functions may or may not receive data as parameters. In the functional Components, the return value is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree.

5) - Transpiling JSX
Transpilation, a portmanteau of transformation and compilation, is the process of converting source code from one high-level programming language to another. Unlike traditional compilers, transpilers don't convert code into machine language; instead, they transform it into another source code language.

6) - Importing components
Modules are standalone units of code that you can reuse again and again. Then you can use the import and export statements to make the false communicate with each other. 

export - The export statement is used to make a module available to another module. It helps to think of every JavaScript file as a module. 
         Then in order to make the functions and variables available to other files, you need to export them. In JavaScript, there are two types of exports, default exports and named exports. 
The default export - It is used when the function name is the same as the file name.
named exports - This are used when you want the function name to be different from the file name. 

Import - In React, to import a component, you use the keyword import, followed by the component name you want to import. Then you use the 
         keyword from, to specify the location of where the component is located. You need to use a file name sequence, such as a dot forward slash before the file name.




* Component Use and Styling *

7) - Props
In React, you can use a similar technique to pass data from one component to another using the properties object or simply props. Props allow you to pass data from one component to another. It's helpful to think of props as arguments a component can accept and are passed using JSX syntax.

8) - Introducing JSX
It seemed that some HTML content is returned. Well, this content is not exactly HTML. It's JSX. JSX syntax looks very similar to HTML. What are its advantages is that it allows you to write JavaScript code inside what looks like HTML elements. In fact, you can think of JSX as a combination of custom HTML and JavaScript.

9) - Styling JSX elements
It is using the link HTML element in the head of the index.html file in which your React app will mount. The href attribute loads some CSS styles, probably with some CSS classes, and then, inside the function component's declarations, you can access those CSS classes using the className attribute.

10) - Embedded JSX expressions
Embedded expressions allow developers to insert the values of JavaScript variables into the HTML of the resulting React elements. Embedded expressions can also embed the outputs of functions.
