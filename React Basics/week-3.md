Navigation, Updating and Assets in React.js
-------------------------------------------




* Linking and Routing *

1) - Basic Types of navigation
The most common navigation components are, a horizontal navigation bar, a vertical navigation menu, a menu hiding behind a button, and a footer navigation menu. The horizontal navigation bar is often referred to as a navbar, and the vertical navigation bar is also known as a sidebar navigation. The menu hiding behind the button is usually represented by an icon. the drop-down navigation menu, known as the mega menu. The footer navigation menu is usually displayed as several visual columns containing links. All these mentioned menu patterns can often be used simultaneously in different parts of the same page.

2) - Routing
In a single-page React Application, routing refers to the process of navigating between different pages without triggering a full page reload. The application initially loads a single HTML page. Then, it dynamically renders different components based on user interaction.

3) - Conditional rendering
It is the process of displaying different content based on certain conditions or states. In an app, you can render components conditionally based on whether a specific state data has specific values. In other words, when you write the rendering logic in the main app component, you'll need to reference the state of the other components.




* Using Assets in React *

4) - Asset  
assets are all the files that your React app needs to have access to in order to work as intended. In React, assets can be things like images, style sheets, fonts, media files, or basically any file that's needed by your app at runtime. You can create an images folder and put your images inside this folder. then import each image file into your component file using import statements. You can define each imported image as a variable.
